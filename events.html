        <strong>Introduction:</strong>
        <p>Raksha Pentest is a hands-on offensive security project that turns every engagement into a strategic "party"—a celebration of breaking, bypassing, and uncovering vulnerabilities in digital systems. Built by hackers, for hackers, Raksha simulates real-world attacks to test the limits of web apps, networks, and services while documenting every step with precision.
        It’s not just a pentest—it’s a show of skill, creativity, and control where the party starts when the firewall fails. From initial recon to root shell, Raksha blends technical depth with a bit of chaos, making it the perfect project for red teamers, CTF enthusiasts, and ethical hackers looking to leave their mark.
